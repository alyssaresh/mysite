After Zip Code, I wanted to return to my roots using HTML, CSS and JS for creative front-end design. Though this course was a refresher, I enjoyed playing around with JS animations to bring more life to a static website. 

Some new things I learned: 

ðŸ’š The use of CSS Variables - as a detail-oriented person who likes clean, readable code and obsesses over color palettes, this helps me maintain a color scheme easily (and change a bunch of properties at once!). 

ðŸŸª Animations in JS - This course taught me how to use the @keyframe annotation, the querySelector function, and event listeners. With these tools, I was able to add animations, transitions, and filters to my page. I was also able to make my main content boxes resize to follow the movements of a user's mouse. 

ðŸ¤” Static vs Dynamic websites - I did a deep dive into the difference between the two, the pros and cons of both, and when to build a Dynamic website vs a Static one (or maybe something in between!). One of my favorite parts of learning has been taking a small question (such as "what are the differences between a static and dynamic website?) and going down the rabbit hole of industry standard practices and opinions. It was great to practice building a static website after building a dynamic one (Flixxer) at Zip Code! 

ðŸ”¨ Build tools/package managers - This was my first time using Node and Parcel to bundle my code. This optimization will be essential as I continue building as a modern web developer - it's all about those load times! I'm looking forward to trying out Webpack as well to see how it compares to Parcel.
